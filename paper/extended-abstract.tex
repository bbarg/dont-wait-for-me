\section{Implementation}
As of the current state of our research, we are testing three naive
implementations of thread-pooled, queue-based web servers, which we
refer to from here on as \verb+http-server+, \verb+msq-server+, and
\verb+lcrq-server+. These implementations serve static content on a single
port, with worker threads sleeping if the work queue is empty. A
single acceptor thread loops on accept and adds connections to the
queue (in the form of client socket file descriptors) as they
arrive. All three servers are written solely in C and use the POSIX
sockets library directly to create and serve client sockets. By
default, the servers support logging of incoming connections to
\verb+stdout+, although in Section 4 we observe a marked performance
increase when logging is disabled.

It should be clarified that none of \verb+http-server+,
\verb+msq-server+, or \verb+lcrq-server+ are intended as full-featured
and robust servers that would at this point in time be used to replace
existing servers (although the their feature-set isn't extremely far
away from that of \verb+lighttpd+). Our goal is to compare event-based
and queue-based server architectures under extremely high load, so we
have chosen minimal queue-based implementation to isolate the
performance of the queue within the server.

\subsection{\verb+http-server+}

This version of the server is the basis for the others, and uses a
singly-locked queue (one lock is used for both enqueueing and
dequeueing). The queue also uses a condition variable that worker
threads may sleep on when no jobs are available.

\subsection{\verb+msq-server+}

This version is a modified copy of \verb+http-server+ with the single
locking queue replaced by an implementation of Michael and Scott's
seminal MPMC lock-free queue [ref to MSQ paper, ref to \verb+sim+]. POSIX
condition variables can no longer be used to implement sleeping on an
empty queue; instead we use a light wrapper over the \verb+futex+ system
call. This particular implementation of the Michael and Scott queue
returns -1 whenever a \verb+dequeue+ fails on an empty queue; we use that
return value as our sleeping condition.

\subsection{\verb+lcrq-server+}

Also a modified copy of \verb+http-sever+, \verb+lcrq-server+ replaces the
locking queue with an implementation of Morrisson and Afek's so-called
LCRQ [reference to lcrq paper]. The LCRQ is a linked list of ring
buffers that uses fetch-and-add as its primary atomic primitive (when
performing operations on an inidividual ring buffer), falling back to
compare-and-swap only when the new ring buffers need to be added to
the linked list. Although LCRQ is an MPMC queue, we only have a single
accepting thread and thus a single enqueuer. Like for the Michael
Scott queue, \verb+dequeue+ returns -1 on an empty queue, so we use the
same \verb+futex+ wrapper to implement sleeping.

\subsection{Acknowledged Limitations}

Currently, we do not have a robust lock-free memory allocation or
memory reclamation strategy in place for \verb+msq-server+ and
\verb+lcrq-server+. When new nodes are needed, the acceptor thread simply
calls \verb+malloc+ within each queue implementation to create a new
node. While this reliance on a locking \verb+malloc+ admittedly affects the
supposed progress guarantee of the lock-free algorithms we use, we
hold that it should not signicantly effect performance, as only the
accepting thread is contending for the \verb+malloc+ lock. Usage or
implementation of a lock-free (or otherwise robust) memory allocator
would likely *improve* server performance, given the options for
per-thread pooling [mckinney reference] and CPU memory locality
[mckinney also?].

As for memory reclamation, the standard and popular lock-free solution
is Maged M. Michael's hazard pointers
[hazard pointers reference]. Hazard pointers allow threads operating
on a shared lock-free object to temporarily ensure that hazardous
references (for example a pointer to the next item in a queue) will
remain valid as long as the thread holds one of a finite number of
hazard pointers to the object. There is a small amount of overhead
associated with hazard pointers, as the implementation requires both
declaring the lifetime of hazardous reference within operations on the
object and a periodic scanning of the global list of hazard pointers
to lazily free nodes. We acknowledge that performance for
\verb+lcrq-server+ and \verb+msq-server+ would likely be slower with a hazard
pointer implementation, but we view generating research claims via
server profiling as a higher priority in our current research than the
production of a hazard pointers implementation.

\section{Testing Strategy}

Our testing strategy centers around two main goals:

\begin{compactitem}
\item What are the traditional bottlenecks of a queue-based web server
  architecture and how could a lock-free queue possibly circumvent
  those?
\item How closely can an optimized version of a lock-free-queue based
   webserver approach the performance (under heavy load) of existing
   web servers +nginx+, +lighttpd+, and +apache+?
\end{compactitem}

For testing, we make heavy use of HP's +httperf+ utility, which allows
sending adjusting the per-second requests rate and setting timeouts,
and which has the crucial feature of continuing to send requests
without recieving replies from the server. This tool, combined with a
fast enough connection to the server, allows us to max out our
servers' capacity for concurrency.

Our tests were run on a rack server with two quad-core Intel Xeon
L5420 2.50 GHz processors, each with a 12 MB L2 cache. The system has
16 GB of RAM and runs Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS (Linux kernel version
3.13.0-46-generic).
