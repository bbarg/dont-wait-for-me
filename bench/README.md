# `bench` testing

## Procedure

For each benchmark, create a new folder with a descriptive name. In
the folder, include two files:

- `procedure.md` that describes your methodology and format of your results
  + test platform
  + description of test
  + what is the test trying to do?
  + what are hypothesized results?
  + short summary of what actually happened, including a nice table if
    possible
  + link to data dump file
- data dump file (name whatever you want)

## Notes

Each test should be repeated 5-10 times.
